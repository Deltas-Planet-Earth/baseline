## Ocean Protocol references

[Ocean Protocol](https://github.com/oceanprotocol) is a technology platform providing decentralized orchestration of AI assets for the Data Economy. Beyond the [extensive documentation](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/) and [open-source code](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/), the following front-facing production components can be visited; 
1) [Public production network](https://commons.oceanprotocol.com/)
2) [Data Science sandbox](https://datascience.oceanprotocol.com/)

## Ocean Protocol AI Assets for satellite data
3 AI Assets are registered in a decentralized network, to serve as a sandbox/proof-of-concept. The assets are listed below; 
1) [Satellite data](https://commons.nile.dev-ocean.com/asset/did:op:3fdcc402b9994d88828e82f9be16e40eaf8eed10036c48ae9a826415e3ca46ce)
1) [Pretrained model for transfer learning](https://commons.nile.dev-ocean.com/asset/did:op:4b8a4bd15e8e429ba7918e8d9005dc58923d0ce408834e0ea9089cd41fc780b3)
1) [Jupyter Notebook for model training](https://commons.nile.dev-ocean.com/asset/did:op:5268ca64d7d843acae995f1712f0941c0dae57fb3ec0491bb6dda83d93f534c0)

The above assets can serve as a base composite asset for generating new assets (better data, models, scripts, etc.), which would be placed on the network with incentives. 

## SingularityNET
SingularityNET is a full-stack AI solution powered by a decentralized protocol that lets anyone create, share, and monetize AI services at scale. We gathered the leading minds in machine learning and blockchain to democratize access to AI technology. Now anyone can take advantage of a global network of AI algorithms, services, and agents. Find the SingularityNET repository [here](https://github.com/singnet). 

### Assets 
1) [**SingularityNET Daemon.**](https://github.com/Deltas-Planet-Earth/snet-daemon) Service Daemon exposes an AI application as an API that is accessible through the SingularityNET Network. It handles all interaction with the blockchain for authorization and payment using AGI tokens and passes through API calls to the AI application.
2) [**SingularityNET CLI.**](https://github.com/Deltas-Planet-Earth/snet-cli). SingularityNET CLI for interacting with SNET blockchain contracts and deployed services.
3) [**SingularityNET Platform Contracts**](https://github.com/Deltas-Planet-Earth/platform-contracts). Smart contracts for running Agents and Services on the SingularityNET open network.
4) [**SingularityNET Dapp**](https://github.com/Deltas-Planet-Earth/snet-dapp). SingularityNET Beta DApp lets you interact with Agents registered on the Kovan network using testnet AGI. 
5) [**SingularityNET Example Service**](https://github.com/Deltas-Planet-Earth/example-service). Simple arithmetic service compatible with SingularityNET platform. Can be used as a starting point to build services on the platform.
6) [**SingularityNET Dev Portal**](https://github.com/Deltas-Planet-Earth/dev-portal). The SingularityNET Developer Portal where you can find all our documentation, tutorials, and developer resources!

## NuNet
NuNet seeks to establish a framework providing globally distributed computing power and storage for decentralized networks. NuNet believes that there is a tremendous amount of unused latent computing resources available that can be put to good use by connecting the owners of data and these computing resources with computational processes that demand them.

NuNet is designed to be an extremely flexible network and connect computing supply and demand from a variety of different sources to multiple types of endpoints. The network is envision to encompass mobile consumer devices, edge computing and IoT devices, personal computers as well as servers and data centers. The interoperability of such a broad network will allow for seamless and intelligent automation of workflow design among its components, and unlock new business models for computing that are available to both individuals and computing consortiums.

_NuNet is a spin-off of Stichting SingularityNET_

## Azure Blockchain Service
ABS is the foundation for blockchain apps in the cloud. It allows you to build, govern, and expand blockchain networks at scale. Azure Blockchain Service Preview simplifies the formation, management, and governance of consortium blockchain networks so you can focus on business logic and app development. Besides this it supports all kind of integration scenarios which are so present in Enterprises and are needed to kickstart all kinds of backend processes based on the Blockchain transactions.

It accelerates Blockchain development and empowers the developer by:
-) Deploy a fully managed blockchain networks in a few simple clicks;
-) Govern at scale with built-in governance and codeless consortia management;
-) Offload blockchain network management so you can focus on application logic;
-) Build blockchain apps with confidence using the dev tools you love and the apps you rely on today;
-) Integrates easily with all kinds of backend processes.
