## Ocean Protocol references

[Ocean Protocol](https://github.com/oceanprotocol) is a technology platform providing decentralized orchestration of AI assets for the Data Economy. Beyond the [extensive documentation](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/) and [open-source code](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/), the following front-facing production components can be visited; 
1) [Public production network](https://commons.oceanprotocol.com/)
2) [Data Science sandbox](https://datascience.oceanprotocol.com/)

## Ocean Protocol AI Assets for satellite data
3 AI Assets are registered in a decentralized network, to serve as a sandbox/proof-of-concept. The assets are listed below; 
1) [Satellite data](https://commons.nile.dev-ocean.com/asset/did:op:3fdcc402b9994d88828e82f9be16e40eaf8eed10036c48ae9a826415e3ca46ce)
1) [Pretrained model for transfer learning](https://commons.nile.dev-ocean.com/asset/did:op:4b8a4bd15e8e429ba7918e8d9005dc58923d0ce408834e0ea9089cd41fc780b3)
1) [Jupyter Notebook for model training](https://commons.nile.dev-ocean.com/asset/did:op:5268ca64d7d843acae995f1712f0941c0dae57fb3ec0491bb6dda83d93f534c0)

The above assets can serve as a base composite asset for generating new assets (better data, models, scripts, etc.), which would be placed on the network with incentives.
